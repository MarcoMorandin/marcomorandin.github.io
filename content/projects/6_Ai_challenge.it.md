## Partnering with Trento’s Energy Provider to Advance the Renewable Transition

### Description
A data-driven solution to support the “Agenzia Provinciale per le Risorse Idriche e l’Energia (APRIE)” in optimizing energy management in the Province of Trento. The project involved cleaning and classifying energy consumption data, forecasting future energy demand using machine learning models, and identifying optimal locations for photovoltaic installations. The results aim to assist policymakers in achieving renewable energy goals outlined in the PEAP 2021-2030 plan.

### Technologies Used
- Data Processing & Storage: SciPy, Pandas, PostgreSQL
- Machine Learning: LSTM, AutoARIMA, AutoETS, Holt-Winters, SciPy Optimization
- Web App: Node.js, Vue.js, Redis

### Key Features
- Data Classification & Cleaning
- Energy Consumption Forecasting
- Photovoltaic Installation Optimization based on production caba
- Interactive Dashboard

### My Role
I contributed to the project by developing and fine-tuning machine learning models for energy forecasting and integrating predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy. Additionally, I operationalized these models and created an interactive dashboard to make the results easily accessible to non-technical users.

### Outcome/Impact
The project provided APRIE with a prototype of an analytical tool to support decision-making on energy policy. The classification model improved data completeness, the forecasting models offered insights into future consumption trends, and the optimization framework guided solar energy investments. The interactive dashboard streamlined data access, with potential future deployment for public use.
