## Smart Shopping Cart Prototype: Enhancing User Experience with Human-Centered Design

A comprehensive analysis of the design process for Intellicart, an intelligent shopping cart system aimed at improving the supermarket experience. The study explored usability, accessibility, and interaction design, focusing on reducing checkout times, optimizing in-store navigation, and enhancing user engagement. The project also evaluated existing smart cart solutions, gathered user insights, and iterated on prototypes to refine the user experience.

### Technologies & Methods Used
- UX Research & Design: User surveys, interviews, PACT analysis, benchmarking
- Prototyping & Evaluation: Low and medium-fidelity prototypes, Nielsen usability heuristics, SUS questionnaires
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Principles: Accessibility, emotional design, Gestalt principles
- Data Gathering & Analysis: Google Forms, Thematic Analysis

### My Role
I develop the project myself. I conducted a detailed analysis of the systemâ€™s usability, benchmarking existing solutions, and gathering user feedback through surveys and interviews. I designed and evaluated low- and medium-fidelity prototypes, applying HCI principles to improve accessibility and user experience. Additionally, I structured the requirements and functional specifications to align with user needs.

### Outcome/Impact
The project demonstrated that a user-centered approach can significantly improve the supermarket shopping experience. By addressing key usability concerns, Intellicart offers a seamless blend of traditional in-store shopping and smart automation. The iterative design process led to a high System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 95/100, indicating strong user acceptance and ease of use.
This project gave me valuable insights into human-centred design processes. Although it is not my main field of study, it was a great experience to learn fundamental concepts of human-computer interaction, providing me with a broader perspective on IT project development.
