## Navigating Legal and Ethical Boundaries in Insurance Claims Management
### Description:
This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in accident reconstruction for insurance claims management, with a focus on compliance with the European AI Act. Leveraging AI-powered 3D simulations and data fusion techniques, the system processes accident photos, telemetry data, and historical records to enhance liability assessments and streamline claims processing.
From a technical standpoint, the project examines the risk classification of such AI systems, identifying key challenges related to bias detection, explainability, and human oversight. Given its high-risk categorization, the system must comply with legal obligations, including data governance, transparency, and accountability. To mitigate risks, the proposed solution ensures that AI acts as an assistive tool, generating objective reconstructions without making liability determinations autonomously.
This project served as the final assignment for the course “Law and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence”. Our goal was to conceptualize a future prototype inspired by emerging trends in the insurance industry, specifically following a hackathon hosted by one of Italy’s leading insurance companies. Rather than developing a technical solution, our work focused on evaluating the feasibility, ethical implications, and potential impact of this conceptual prototype.

### Takeaways:
Through this project, I gained a foundational understanding of the legal and ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, which are critical for responsible innovation in the field. These insights are essential for navigating the complex implications of AI deployment, ensuring compliance with regulations, and addressing societal concerns such as privacy, fairness, and accountability. This knowledge equips me to contribute to AI development that is not only technically proficient but also ethically sound and legally robust.
