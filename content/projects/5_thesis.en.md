## Predictive Maintenance Strategy for Legacy Industrial Devices
In my bachelor’s final dissertation, I tackled a real-world industrial challenge: how to integrate predictive maintenance into legacy industrial devices that lack built-in monitoring capabilities. The project was designed to align with the principles of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, enabling businesses to extend the lifespan of existing machinery, improve operational efficiency, and reduce waste, all while leveraging modern AI and IoT technologies.

### Project Overview
The primary objective was to develop a scalable and data-driven predictive maintenance system capable of forecasting potential failures and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery. This system was designed using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment in real-world industrial settings.

The project involved:
- IoT-based data collection from external sensors installed on legacy machines
- Real-time data streaming and processing for anomaly detection and predictive insights
- Machine learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict equipment failures based on time-series data

### Technologies and Implementation
To handle the high-frequency sensor data and enable real-time analytics, I implemented a robust software architecture incorporating:
- MQTT for lightweight, real-time sensor data ingestion
- Apache Kafka for high-throughput, real-time data streaming and event-driven processing
- TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL-based) for efficient time-series data storage and querying
- RESTful APIs and WebSockets for system interaction and real-time data visualization
- LSTM neural networks for time-series forecasting of equipment failures

The predictive model was trained using a dataset generated by a physics-based industrial simulator. After rigorous testing and validation, the model achieved:
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 8.6%
- Coefficient of Determination (R²) of 0.97, indicating high predictive accuracy

### Industrial Application and Internship Experience
This project was developed in part during my internship at Thinkin, a Trento-based company specializing in Industrial IoT solutions, particularly in indoor tracking and asset monitoring. During the internship, I focused on:
- Developing the sensor data management system, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage
- Building real-time event-driven services to trigger maintenance alerts based on sensor data
- Collaborating on the predictive maintenance implementation

### Key Achievements and Takeaways
- Designed a fully operational, scalable predictive maintenance system that can be easily integrated into industrial settings
- Applied advanced machine learning techniques (LSTM) to real-world industrial challenges
- Developed a resilient microservices-based architecture for handling high-frequency sensor data
- Gained hands-on experience with IoT, event-driven systems, time-series databases, and AI-powered decision-making
- Aligned the solution with Industry 5.0 sustainability goals by retrofitting existing machinery instead of replacing it

### Future Work and Industry Impact
The work done in this dissertation can be further expanded by:
- Implementing a machine learning pipeline (MLOps) with TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for automated model retraining and deployment
- Integrating failure classification models to predict not just Remaining Useful Life but also the type of failure expected
- Enhancing real-time notification and event services, integrating the predictive insights with automated maintenance workflows

This project was more than just an academic exercise—it was a practical, industry-relevant solution that reflects my ability to engineer real-world AI applications that drive efficiency, sustainability, and innovation in modern industries.
