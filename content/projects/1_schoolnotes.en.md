## Smart Shopping Cart Prototype: Enhancing User Experience with Human-Centered Design

SchoolNotes is a web application designed to facilitate the sharing of class notes among high school students and teachers. Developed over six months with two classmates, it was one of my first major projects in high school, providing hands-on experience in full-stack development and authentication systems. The platform enables students to upload notes, teachers to review and approve content, and users to browse materials based on subjects. By integrating modern authentication mechanisms, SchoolNotes enhances accessibility and security while fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Unfortunately professors required us to develop it in PHP.ü•≤

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: PHP, Symfony, Doctrine ORM
- **Frontend**: Twig (Symfony Template Engine), Bootstrap
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Project Management**: Agile methodology

### Key Features
- Role-Based Access Control: Teachers review and approve student-submitted notes before publication, ensuring quality content.
- Google Login Integration: Secure authentication using Google accounts for seamless access, eliminating the need for additional credentials.
- Organized Note-Sharing System: Notes are categorized by subject and accessible to all registered users.
- Batch User Registration: Admins can bulk import student and teacher accounts for easy onboarding.

### My Role
As part of this collaborative project, I contributed to both frontend and backend development, while my final high school dissertation focused on implementing the ‚ÄúLogin with Google‚Äù feature. I conducted research on authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, compared various security models, and successfully integrated the feature using Symfony‚Äôs OAuth2 Client Bundle. This implementation improved the platform‚Äôs security and usability, allowing students and teachers to log in effortlessly using their school-issued Google accounts.

### Outcome/Impact
SchoolNotes successfully provided a structured and accessible platform for students and teachers, streamlining the sharing of educational materials. The integration of Google login improved user experience and security, making authentication more convenient and reliable. This project was a significant milestone in my development journey.
