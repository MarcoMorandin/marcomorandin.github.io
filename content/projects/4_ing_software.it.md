## Smart Management Software for Trento’s Photovoltaic Panels with Predictive Maintenance

A smart monitoring and forecasting system designed for the Municipality of Trento to track the energy production of photovoltaic plants installed on public buildings. The system not only provides real-time insights into production but also integrates predictive analytics to anticipate maintenance needs and peak production periods. When a critical event is detected, a Telegram bot notifies the responsible personnel, ensuring efficient energy management.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend & API**: Express from Node.js, Flask from Python, MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost model from SciPy
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, Tailwind
- **Deployment CI/CD**: Azure, Render.com, GitHub Actions
- **Designing**: System actors diagram, Requirements definition, Use Case diagram, BPMN diagram, Component diagram, 
- **Project Management**: Agile Methodology

### Key Features
- Photovoltaic Monitoring: Real-time tracking of solar energy production from municipal buildings.
- Predictive Maintenance: Machine learning models forecast potential failures based on energy production trends and weather data.
- Peak Production Forecasting: Predictions help optimize energy utilization and reduce waste.
- Automated Notifications: A Telegram bot alerts operators about maintenance needs or expected high production days.
- Interactive Dashboard: Provides clear data visualization and historical analysis.

### My Role
I worked on the project with my flatmate, and we worked together on all the parts of it.

### Outcome/Impact
The system gives the Municipality of Trento a tool that uses data to help them manage energy better and plan maintenance more efficiently. By using predictive analytics, the project makes things more efficient, reduces costs, and supports green energy plans. On top of that, the project was named the second best of the twenty projects in the "Software Engineering" course in 2024.
